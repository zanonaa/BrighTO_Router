# BrighTO-Router — Rust LLM Gateway, Model Load Balancer, and SystemOne Router

**Million-token AI traffic, simple Rust fast path, one Docker install.**

BrighTO-Router, also searchable as **Brighto LLM Router**, is a free open-source, self-hosted LLM gateway, AI router, and SystemOne decision router written in Rust. It gives teams one stable API endpoint for OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, cloud, local, Ollaya/Laya, and JEV/DJEV-style System One backends with model load balancing, fallback routing, team API keys, token budgets, usage analytics, and privacy-first logging.

## Why this exists

Most teams do not need a large hosted AI platform to start. They need a fast, understandable LLM API proxy that they can run, audit, and maintain. BrighTO-Router focuses on the traffic path: authenticate, enforce budget, choose model route or Model Group, forward the request, stream the response, and record usage metadata.

## Core features

- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/embeddings`
- Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages`
- System One decisions through `/v1/systemone` and `/v1/decisions`
- Rerank and ASR adapter routes
- OAuth provider routes for Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex, and xAI Grok subscription accounts, renewed automatically
- Round-robin and weighted Model Groups for load balancing
- Team API keys, expiry, token budgets, RPM limits, and concurrency limits
- PostgreSQL usage ledger and Portal dashboard
- No prompt or response content stored by default
- One-line Docker install

## Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thusinh1969/BrighTO_Router/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then open:

```

## Architecture

- [v1.1.0 architecture](architecture/brighto-router-workflow.html) — Portal, Admin API, PostgreSQL snapshot, Rust hot path, adapters, Model Groups, SystemOne, ledger, and release gates.
- [PostgreSQL data flow](postgresql-data-flow.html) — durable control plane, Model Group counters, usage ledger, and JSONL fallback.
- [API examples](API_EXAMPLES.md) — Python calls for Chat Completions, Completions, Responses, embeddings, rerank, ASR, System One, and Anthropic Messages.
- [Load-balancing test notes](REAL_LOAD_BALANCING_TESTS.md) — round-robin and weighted Model Group validation.

## Repository and Docker image

- GitHub: [thusinh1969/BrighTO_Router](https://github.com/thusinh1969/BrighTO_Router)
- Docker: `thusinh1969/brighto_airouter:v1.1.0`
- Release: `v1.1.0`

## Benchmarks

BrighTO-Router publishes deterministic mock-backend benchmarks to measure router overhead, not model inference speed. The 1M-token and Model Group artifacts are in the repository under `benchmarks/artifacts/`.
